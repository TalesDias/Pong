# Pong
Pong Game in pygame and PyQt5

Realy simple pong game
Later on I will create two new IA's
Unfortunately i will not upgrade the GUI, is not my intention to focus on beauty

side note: difficulty changes with the size of the screen and velocity of the bar and the ball
i have not balanced it yet, so i don't know good values for them, feel free to discover

CONTROLS
w - left bar up
s - left bar down
arrow up - right bar up
arrow down - left bar down
p - pauses the game
k - exits the game
